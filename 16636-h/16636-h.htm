<span class="i0">To heaving body and pleading cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here where the lost battalions lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I walked last night with a ghost.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His face was gray, his hands were red,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a ghostly mare he rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wearily stepped, with drooping head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the shadowy lines of dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolled her eyes, and shook with dread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under her foam-white load.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ghost turned not to left or right.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But mutely he beckoned me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moved like a pillar of livid light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the humid dark of the foggy night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes deep-sunken and greenly bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As phosphor on the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He led me where in ghostly files<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The dead slept with their toys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miles, miles, and never-ending miles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the valley's mournful aisles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voiceless, vague, misshapen piles<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of men and golden boys!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He led me up the gory hill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By wood and sodden heath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ravage! And faces, lone and chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the murmuring wash of the willow-rill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slaughter! And voices, begging shrill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The merciful grace of death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A waning moon broke, sickly pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the muddy fog's disguising;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the breadth of the ghastly vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle-wake like a steamer's trail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a heaving as of waves in a gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rising and falling and rising!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And out of the air, and up from the plain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of stricken love and laughter slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearts beneath the hoofs of pain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a breath of human gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And not a word of glory.<br /></span>

<p><i>In costuming this play, it is essential that the uniforms of the
Iberian officers in the first scene should not be conspicuously copied
after those of any of the armies of Europe. A compromise, grotesque to
the expert, would be better here than a misleading realism.</i></p>

<h2>SCENE I</h2>

<p><i>A room in the Ministry of War in the capital of Iberia.</i></p>

<p><i>Evening.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">minister of war</span>, <i>a tall, stern, bearded man with
deep-set eyes and many furrows, is sitting at a large, mahogany
desk-table, Left.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">chief of staff</span>, <i>silent, motionless and watchful, stands
beside him with his hands resting on the table-top. He is thin, old and
emaciated, clean-shaven, firm-lipped, and looks startlingly like a bird
of prey. Right, stands a group of generals and other officers.</i></p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Rising and speaking in a sharp, crisp bass voice.</i></p>

<p>I can only repeat, gentlemen, what his Excellency, the Chief of Staff,
has already made clear to you. Nothing has been decided. You have your
orders in your pockets. There may be war and there may not be war. I
understand, gentlemen, your natural impatience once more to draw the
naked steel for the glory of our country, and you may rest assured that
his gracious majesty, the King, will not forget that his fame and the
happiness of his people rests ultimately in your hands. Personally, as a
man of family and as a Christian, I hope to God that peace may be
preserved. But if God wills that our enemy, by his insolence, forces us
to draw the sword, I know that you will wield it with honor and will not
sheathe it until our enemy is crushed, root and branch, stock and
barrel, and brought so low that he will never raise his head again in
dishonorable defiance of our holy rights.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">officers</span> <i>shout with enthusiasm, lifting their helmets
in air. The</i> <span class="smcap">minister of war</span> <i>sits down again.</i></p>

<p>That is all, gentlemen.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With a grim smile.</i></p>

<p>But I recommend that you do not send your service uniforms to the tailor
tonight. You may have need of them.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>There is another cheer. The</i> <span class="smcap">officers</span> <i>stand about in groups
a minute or so, then file out through the double-door in the centre of
the rear wall. One elderly general, only, comes up quickly to the desk.</i></p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">general</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>In a rasping voice, to the</i> <span class="smcap">chief of staff</span>.</p>

<p>Delay again? Aren't we ever going to get at their throats?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p>We are ready. But the King!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He shrugs his shoulders.</i></p>

<p>The peace propagandists are after him. Mediation is the magic word.
Mediation&mdash;by which the neutral nations block our legitimate road to
victory for their own benefit, in the name of civilization and progress.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">general</span></p>

<p>Old women's talk.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With a swagger.</i></p>

<p>Give me a sword in my right hand again, I say! I'll break open a few
skulls yet, for all my sixty years. Eh? Mediation! Let those mediate, I
say, who are afraid to fight!</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Calmly, dispassionately.</i></p>

<p>We are not mediating yet. You may tell that to your friends if they
become downhearted.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">general</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Saluting.</i></p>

<p>To command, your Excellency! It is good that some one looks out for the
honor of the army.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Saluting again.</i></p>

<p>Good night, gentlemen!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">minister of war</span> <i>half rises and bows slightly. The</i>
<span class="smcap">chief of staff</span> <i>nods. Exit the</i> <span class="smcap">general</span>.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With a flash in his old eyes.</i></p>

<p>Ha! Once more to have those fellows behind me. Think of it! Each man of
them represents fifty thousand. And behind them another million and
another! God! What a machine to handle.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He slaps his forehead.</i></p>

<p>And the old brain working still!</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Rising and crossing to a window, right forward, then speaking
thoughtfully.</i></p>

<p>I don't know, Clement. I am growing old. I think sometimes that war is
the most terrible matter in which we erring humans become engaged. I
have always thought that&mdash;at times.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Who has crossed to the Left and stands facing a map of the world,
covering half the wall.</i></p>

<p>So you are a sentimentalist, after all?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Looking out of the window.</i></p>

<p>No. Because there is something stronger in me, conquering the repulsion.
My temperament, character, destiny. I am impelled to war. A dozen
generations of soldiers in my blood press me on. My whole education
presses me on. My sympathies and my religious sense make me tremble
before the impending horror, but&mdash;I confess to you&mdash;I believe I want
this war.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Without turning.</i></p>

<p>So do we all. War is the soldier's work. And he does not want to play
all his life. Look. We land here and here and here.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He indicates places on the map with a paper-cutter, speaking with
growing excitement.</i></p>

<p>No defenses, except at this place&mdash;a masonry fort built thirty years
ago. Bad cement, moreover. Fraudulent contractor. Then&mdash;</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Returning to his desk, resolutely.</i></p>

<p>No, you old hawk, we're not going to do it. We'll be content to settle
ourselves in peaceful graves, you and I and the old Chief. No war, no
war!</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Calmly.</i></p>

<p>That is sentiment. Here is fact. We land here and here and here. Then
march down here and up there, uniting the armies. Rich country. I've
never seen it, but I know it better than any letter-carrier in the
district. We live on the land, burning and pillaging if the inhabitants
don't give us what we want. A little dose will tame them. We'll sweep
all before us in six weeks.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>In mock protest.</i></p>

<p>Stop, man, stop! You make me want to try it.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p>I can't stop. It's a game with me. I play it all day in my thoughts and
all night I direct campaigns in my dreams. A great game. Only sometimes
I get tired of playing it on paper, and want to hear the real guns and
see the real battalions.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>A</i> <span class="smcap">secretary</span> <i>enters with a message.</i></p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">secretary</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>To Minister of War.</i></p>

<p>A message from the King sent over from the Foreign Office. The Prime
Minister was not there.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p>Let me have it.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He takes the message and glances at it.</i></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With a gesture to the Secretary.</i></p>

<p>That will do.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">secretary</span>.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Flaring up.</i></p>

<p>Look at this, look at it! The King is sending our national honor to the
dogs. He has secretly resumed communication with the Ambassador of the
Republic, instead of doing what was natural and constitutional, sending
the man to us. He is going to compromise. Pack up your tin soldiers, old
man. Take them home for your grandchildren to play with. Our country
evidently has no more use for them.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With compressed lips.</i></p>

<p>Show me.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He takes the paper and reads its contents aloud.</i></p>

<p>"The King desires to inform the Foreign Office that, in pursuance of
his well-known love of peace, he sent for the Ambassador of the Republic
this afternoon and outlined a plan that would satisfy the royal
government and at the same time yield certain points to the government
of the Republic. The Ambassador was courteous, but, although
acknowledging the generosity of the King's offer, regretted that he was
unable to consider any compromise before communicating again with his
government. The King replied that if his offers were refused he could
then have nothing further to say in the matter, but would have to turn
it over entirely to his Ministers.</p>

<p>"The King suggests to the Foreign Office that these facts be put before
our Ambassadors abroad, and, to pacify the public mind, be given at once
to the newspapers."</p>

<p>My God, and you want peace!</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Harshly.</i></p>

<p>Well, how do you like it?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p>He's backed down, he's backed down. All the world will be shouting
tomorrow how our King has backed down. <i>Christo!</i> To accept defeat
before you've begun to fight!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>He turns again to the map.</i></p>

<p>If this other plan should be frustrated by the enemy's navy, look, we
could land here and here and&mdash;</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I have seen fit to abbreviate the King's message. I have not
altered a word nor added a word. I have merely omitted all that did not
seem to me pertinent or useful. The message reads as follows: "The King
sent for the Ambassador of the Republic this afternoon and outlined a
plan that would satisfy the royal government. The Ambassador regretted
that he was unable to consider any compromise. The King replied that
then he could have nothing more to say in the matter."</p>

<p>It is the report of your Majesty's interview with the Ambassador.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Glancing at the paper and speaking in quick, excited tones.</i></p>

<p>My message has been altered. It was conciliatory. It is a challenge now.
Who did this?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>Your Majesty sees the culprit before you.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p>Are you trying to make war?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>I am trying, your Majesty, to save the country from the results of your
Majesty's indiscretion in calling the Ambassador to your palace without
consulting your Ministers. If we do not strike now we lose our prestige
as a great nation, our national honor is dragged in the dust. We have to
fight. We cannot afford to back down.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Striding across the room, agitatedly.</i></p>

<p>But this is unholy, barbaric&mdash;this deliberate concoction of a great,
terrible war. I saw clearly this evening as I was talking with the
Ambassador how utterly without inner necessity this war-scare is. It is
a made thing from beginning to end, and I refuse absolutely to sanction
it.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Deliberately.</i></p>

<p>Your Majesty is an idealist. We are practical, and, I may say,
far-seeing men. And we are the three men, perhaps, who have given your
Majesty the chair you sit on and made your kingdom what it is.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Drawing himself up.</i></p>

<p>I think I have not been ungrateful. But my people come first, and I will
not have my people plunged into misery for no valid and inevitable
necessity.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>Your Majesty, I have served you for fifteen years and I served your
exalted father for twenty. You are right. This war may be avoided. In
two days this war-cloud could be so utterly dissipated that men would
laugh here and in the great Republic that for a day they had talked so
hotly of war. Dissipated. For a year, for two years. For always? No. The
war must come sooner or later. It is a matter, in the first place, of
prestige, of national honor. But, more emphatically, it is a question of
mathematics, birth-rate, death-rate, revenue, taxes, industries,
imports, exports.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Crossing to left.</i></p>

<p>There is a map of the world, your Majesty. This stretch of land there we
need as a safety-valve. If we get that we are safe. If we fail to get it
we explode. Not at once. But sooner or later. Our army and navy have
never been in better shape. These two gentlemen can give your Majesty
their word for that. But you can take mine, too. The enemy's army is
politically rotten, and enfeebled by sentimental peace propaganda. Their
defenses are inadequate and their navy likewise. Those things will
change. Strike today&mdash;and they never raise their heads again. Wait&mdash;and
it is you who may be crushed.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Sharply.</i></p>

<p>That is a theory. Not a fact. Ten years may change the aspect of things
entirely, particularly if we use those ten years in preparations not for
war but for peace, honest at home and abroad, just, open, civil, to our
neighbors.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>Your Majesty, I look farther than ten years, farther than ten times ten
years. And I have wrought for this moment, prepared for this moment,
this moment of our strength and our enemy's weakness. I have a right to
insist that I, who have brought your kingdom thus far, shall not have my
hands tied when the moment for stern action arrives.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>With a whimsical smile.</i></p>

<p>After all, my good Prime Minister, it is <i>my</i> kingdom, you know.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Moved.</i></p>

<p>Your Majesty knows that what I have done I have done for your glory.
The liberals have cursed me for a reactionary through the length and
breadth of the kingdom; because I served you, and served you in all love
and devotion.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p>I know your devotion. But give me a fresh example of it. Keep my kingdom
at peace with the world.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>That I cannot do.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p>You cannot? You <i>will</i> not.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>I could not face my conscience, or make my peace with God, if I weakened
now and allowed the golden opportunity to pass by. For your Majesty's
sake as well as for our country's.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p>For mine?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>Your Majesty has forgotten that your throne was built by war and rests
on force. Force only, military prestige only, can uphold you. The rebels
of labor have crept close to your throne now. Ten more years of peace,
and you are cast out overnight, to wander over Europe, a homeless
absurdity, a king without a chair to sit on.</p>

<p>May I ask your Majesty in all humility and devotion to give me back that
slip of paper?</p>

<p>You have thought of our national honor, our prestige, our commercial
growth, our dynastic life. Have you given no thought at all to the men
you send to death to purchase these?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>My God, your Majesty! You are letting a sentiment master you. There are
worse things than war. There are possibilities in peace infinitely worse
than any war, or there would be no war. War may kill a million bodies,
but a wicked peace can snuff out unnumbered souls!</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">king</span></p>

<p>I will take my chances with peace.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">minister of war</span></p>

<p>It is for you we are fighting, your Majesty, but not for you only, not
for your glory only and the permanence of your House, but for the
permanence of the monarchical principle, which we know is better and
higher than the principle of democracy, since it is the earthly symbol
of God's singleness of rule, and comes direct from God.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">chief of staff</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Coolly.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, your Majesty, it works!</p>

democracy.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">prime minister</span></p>

<p>Your Majesty does not see far enough. Give us war, and we keep our
monarchy. Give us peace, and we plunge within ten years into the rapids

Taney, this is worse than Monte Carlo. You're dealing with cold-blooded
chance there, but here you're dealing with sentiments, emotions. It's
exhausting. War is a terrible thing, Taney. It worries me day and night.

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">conroy</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Without looking up, good-naturedly.</i></p>

<p>Grosvenor, we've known each other thirty years. I don't try to bluff you
because I know that you know too much about me. You made the beginnings
of your pile out of one big war and you've been playing up a lot of
little republics against each other ever since, harvesting a neat
little fortune every time. Now it's a real world-war you're after. If it
comes, you're made, if it don't, you're broke. It's a cinch. Mind you,
I'm not throwing stones. Only I don't want you to think you can pull the
noble patriotic guff on me.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">grosvenor</span></p>

<p>I have certain investments, of course, which might possibly be promoted
by a war. But I am not thinking of that. I am thinking of the honor of
my country, that honor which has never yet been stained, and shall not
be stained if I can do aught by my own efforts and by my prayers to God,
to keep it pure.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">conroy</span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Rising.</i></p>

<p>You carry it off well. I couldn't bluff the way you can. I haven't your
religious feeling. I know why I want war. It's because I'm a
manufacturer of guns. Everybody knows my business, and they know that if
there wasn't war or a fear of war constantly, I and my wife and children
would starve. War is my work and it's been my work most of my life. And
I've worked for this war because it was the biggest thing in sight. I've
worked for it with all the brains I've got, just as I'd have worked for
two-hundred-egg hens if I'd been a chicken farmer. I'm not a
sentimentalist. Besides, war's a good thing occasionally. I believe that
absolutely. It quiets down your socialists, cuts down your superfluous
population, increases the moral stamina of the nation. A lot of this
talk of war being hell is mush. A few people get shot up, but no one
forced 'em to go. It's their own funeral.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">grosvenor</span></p>

<p>No, Conroy, no. I don't agree with you. I may possibly not lose
financially by this war, but nevertheless, war is terrible, awful. The
Christian sense balks at it. Only, I feel this way, sometimes when the
honor of the nation demands&mdash;</p>

<p>my papers tell me so.</p>

truth.</p>

<p>Well, this time, trust them. What if they do lie about facts

<p class="direction">[<i>Standing at the window.</i></p>

<p>Because the people are smelling blood. That's why. And now they won't
let up till they're satisfied. I've watched the war-feeling growing for
a year. I tried 'em out on headlines and editorials, first little mild
fellows to set them thinking. Then, when their thoughts were set toward
trouble, well, we increased the percentage of oxygen.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Thoughtfully.</i></p>

<p>It's been extremely interesting. The psychology of crowds is one of the
most satisfying subjects I have ever studied. Say, fifteen, twenty
millions, that individually hate you, but as a crowd, a body of readers,
unconsciously, perhaps, even against their will, do exactly what you
say. We're going to have war, because the people have now got to a state
in which they believe that nothing short of war will save them from
utter ruin. They want war. I know it. The circulation of my papers has
mounted by the hundred thousand daily. And it isn't only because the
people want the news. They want the excitement. It's the gambling
instinct in them. They've seen the ball rolling, and they can't keep out
of the game. The very bigness of the thing lures them on; the bigger the
issue, the bigger the fascination. The millions of men and the billions
of dollars&mdash;that lures them. And the awfulness&mdash;the dead, the wounded,
the horrors, that lures them like nothing else. There was one thing
missing until tonight.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Fascinated.</i></p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">pollen</span></p>

<p>Fear. They were too cocksure. But I gave them fear in the eight o'clock
extra. There was a rumor that the rest of Europe would take part.</p>

<p class="boldcenter"><span class="smcap">grosvenor</span></p>

<p>We're playing the thing up in the late editions all over the country.
It'll give the people a queer catch in the throat. They'll see the
possibility of a fierce struggle, even of defeat. There'll be a
wonderful wave of patriotism. You watch. The people'll rise right up. In
twenty-four hours there won't be a man in the country that'll be able to
tell black from white. All they'll see will be red.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Pointing out of the window.</i></p>

<p>Look at the people out there, standing round. They can't stay indoors.
They're waiting for the extras. They won't believe 'em when they read
'em, but they can't resist the excitement. Well, the bonfire's ready.

them from end to end. And there'll be less talk of war then! You and
your kind are stirring up the millions to dream of war, to shout about
defending our national honor&mdash;What honor is there in murder?&mdash;stirring
their blood with the fifes and drums of your rhetoric! Through your
newspapers, you are turning the thoughts of our children to war, our
children who should be to us the symbol of a nobler, purer future
rising out of the sordid wreckage of the present&mdash;you make them drunk
with your cant about national glory&mdash;<i>glory!</i>&mdash;until their innocent
faces glow feverishly up to you, hungry for battle. You will not rest
until you hear the terrible savage cry from their lips&mdash;War, war! You
shall not hear it if I can prevent it! I am going to the Senate now. In
fifteen minutes your names shall be a byword and a hissing among the
nations. The best you can do is to take your vile guns and turn them on
yourselves!</p>

<h2>SCENE III</h2>


<p>[<i>The stage grows light again. In the foreground, a black group of trees
may be dimly discerned; beyond are indistinct hills and the last glow of
a bloody sunset. Smoke and dust blacken the scene. Even before the cloud
breaks to reveal the valley for a moment, the low roar is suddenly
broken by the rattle of musketry, followed by the booming of artillery
and the drumming sound of the machine guns. A trumpet sounds the charge.
The dust cloud breaks. A thickly crowded mass of men is vaguely seen
through the twilight charging with cries and curses. The rear ranks
press over the fallen, waver, shout and fall back. The rattle of
musketry continues. The men return to the charge, are repulsed once more
with awful slaughter and again return. The dust cloud passes over the
scene. It is night now. The wounded are tossing on the field, shrieking.
Ghouls prowl about. A flock of buzzards flies across the moon. In the
distance is heard a shout of victory, then the national anthem once
more, played by a trumpeter. A thousand voices seem to rise out of the
ground, moaning, drowning out the music. Then a woman's voice, clear and
distinct.</i></p>

<p class="adedition"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.35 net</i></p>


<p>A great many people already know Mr. Hagedorn through his verse. "Faces
in the Dawn" will, however, be their introduction to him as a novelist.
The same qualities that have served to raise his poetry above the common
level help to distinguish this story of a German village. The theme of
the book is the transformation that was wrought in the lives of an
irritable, domineering German pastor and his wife through the influence
of a young German girl and her American lover. Sentiment, humor, and a
human feeling, all present in just the right measure, warm the heart and
contribute to the enjoyment which the reader derives in following the
experiences of the well-drawn characters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Masefield's new poetical drama is a piece of work such as only
the author of 'Nan' and 'The Tragedy of Pompey' could have written,
tense in situation and impressive in its poetry.... In addition to
this important play, the volume contains some new and powerful
narrative poems of the sea&mdash;the men who live on it and their ships.
There are also some shorter lyrics as well as an impressive poem on
the present war in Europe which expresses, perhaps, better than
anything yet written, the true spirit of England in the present

<p class="adedition"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net</i></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Present Hour" is a vital expression of America in themes of
war and peace. The first section (War) contains the gripping
narrative poem "Fight: The Tale of a Gunner," and a series of
powerful poems dealing with the great struggle in Europe. Few
war-poems of the many published in this country and England reveal
such sincerity, force and imagery, as these of Mr. MacKaye. Among
them are "American Neutrality," "Peace," "Wilson," "Louvain,"
"Rheims," "The Muffled Drums," "Magna Carta," "France," "A Prayer
of the Peoples," etc. The second section (Peace) includes his
widely read poems, "Goethals," "Panama Hymn," "School," "The Heart
in the Jar," and other representative work. The volume is an
important addition to Mr. MacKaye's long list of books and a
valuable contribution to the poetry of our time.</p></div>

<p class="adtitle">The Congo and Other Poems</p>
<p><span class="smcap">By Vachel Lindsay</span>. Cloth, 12mo. $1.25
net.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the readings which he has given throughout the country Mr.
Lindsay has won the approbation of the critics and of his audiences
in general for the new verse form which he is employing. The
wonderful effects of sound produced by his lines, their relation to
the idea which the author seeks to convey and their marvelous
lyrical quality are something, it is maintained, quite out of the
ordinary and suggest new possibilities and new meanings in poetry.
In this book are presented a number of Mr. Lindsay's most daring
experiments, that is to say they <i>were</i> experiments when they were
first tried; they have been more than justified by their reception.
It is believed that the volume will be one of the most discussed of
all the year's output.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">By Wilfrid Wilson Gibson</span>, Author of "Daily Bread," "Fires,"
"Womenkind," etc. Cloth, 12mo. $1.25 net.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With the publication of <i>Daily Bread</i> Mr. Gibson was hailed as a
new poet of the people. <i>Fires</i>, his later volume, confirmed the
impression that here was a man whose writing was close to real
life, a man in whom were combined a sympathy and appreciation of
humankind with a rare lyrical genius. This present book continues
the work which Mr. Gibson can do so well. In it are brought
together three plays and a number of short lyrics which reveal
again his very decided talent. It is a collection which should
indeed gratify those students of modern verse who are looking to
such men as Gibson and Masefield for permanent and representative
contributions to literature.</p></div>

<p class="adtitle">The Melting Pot</p>
<p><span class="smcap">By Israel Zangwill</span>. Revised edition. Cloth, 12mo.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a revised edition of what is perhaps Mr. Zangwill's most
popular play. Numerous changes have been made in the text, which
has been considerably lengthened thereby. The appeal of the drama
to the readers of this country is particularly strong, in that it
deals with that great social process by which all nationalities are
blended together for the making of the real American.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">By Amy Lowell</span>, Author of "A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass."
Boards, 12mo. $1.25 net.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of the poets who to-day are doing the interesting and original
work, there is no more striking and unique figure than Amy Lowell.
The foremost American member of the "Imagists"&mdash;a group of poets
that includes William Butler Yeats, Ezra Pound, Ford Madox
Hueffer&mdash;she has won wide recognition for her writing in new and
free forms of poetical expression. Miss Lowell's present volume of
poems, "Sword Blades and Poppy Seed," is an unusual book. It
contains much perhaps that will arouse criticism, but it is a new
note in American poetry. Miss Lowell has broken away from academic
traditions and written, out of her own time, real singing poetry,
free, full of new effects and subtleties.</p></div>

<p class="adauthor"><big><span class="smcap">By</span> CONRAD AIKEN</big></p>
<p class="adedition"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net</i></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Conrad Aiken is one of the first American writers to choose to tell
his stories in verse. Helston, Masefield, and other Europeans have
been doing it with marked success, but hitherto this country has
had no notable representative in this line of endeavor. Though Mr.
Aiken has been writing for a number of years, <i>Earth Triumphant and
Other Tales in Verse</i> is his first published book. In it are
contained, in addition to the several narratives of modern life, a
number of shorter lyrics. It is a volume distinguished by
originality and power.</p></div>



<p class="adtitle">Van Zorn: A Comedy in Three Acts</p>
<p class="adauthor"><big><span class="smcap">By</span> EDWIN A. ROBINSON</big></p>
<p class="adedition"><i>Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 net</i></p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>This play makes delightful reading and introduces in the person of
its author a playwright of considerable promise. Mr. Robinson tells
an interesting story, one which by a clever arrangement of incident
and skillful characterization arouses strongly the reader's
curiosity and keeps it unsatisfied to the end. The dialogue is
bright and the construction of the plot shows the work of one well
versed in the technique of the drama.</p></div>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
